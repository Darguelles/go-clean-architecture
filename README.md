# Go clean architecture

This project is an application example to understand clean code practices applied to Go and learn 
how this language works. Based on a real project implementation, so any feedback is welcome.

## Tech-stack
- [OpenApi](https://swagger.io/specification/)
- [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/guide)
- [AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/es/sdk-for-go/)

## Execution
This project has a Makefile to improve the developer experience
- `make gen` to generate openapi files
- `make start` to init the server

Note: This project is in early steps, as a part of my series **Clean Architecture with Go**. Future chapters
will improve the code and add more functionalities.
